# Plant Recognition System

## Overview
This project aims to develop an automated system for recognizing various types of plants and crops, retrieving their names and details from the internet, and providing a description of each plant/crop. The system will utilize machine learning techniques to train a recognition model using a dataset of images of different plants and crops.

## Features
- Recognize about 100 types of plants and crops.
- Retrieve names and details of plants/crops from the internet.
- Provide a description of each recognized plant/crop.
- Expose the solution as an API for easy integration.
- Implement logging for tracking actions performed by the system.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of various plants and crops collected from the internet. Each image is annotated to prepare it for training the recognition model. The dataset repository can be found [here](link_to_dataset_repository).
